## About 
This is an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm in C++. The Banker's Algorithm is an algorithm that helps systems to avoid deadlock by testing for safety before allocating resource to a given process. This safety check consists of simulating allocating those resources to a given process, and then checking that a order of resource allocation exists where all pending resources can be run. 

This assignment was completed for CS 33211: Operating Systems to furfill the requirements of Project 2. 

## Running The Program
This program can be run by the following command inside the main directory: 

`g++ bankers.cpp -o banker`

`./banker`
